### 👋 Hi, I’m Juan Giraldo<br/>

👨‍🎓 I’m currently studying Software Engineering in Medellín, where I’m gaining advanced knowledge in development and emerging technologies.<br/>
✈️ I love traveling and exploring new places, as I believe every location offers a fresh perspective and enriches my personal and professional life.<br/>
💻 I specialize in FrontEnd development, working with technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks to create engaging and functional user interfaces.<br/>
🌍 I’m interested in integrating technology with global experiences and seek opportunities to combine my career in engineering with my passion for travel and cultural discovery.<br/>
